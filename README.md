## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

Starting with a mobile first mindset, this simple landing page was built to keep everything in the center of the viewport. Images are not too large and there is a collapsible menu in the top right.

When viewing on wider devices, the sections will align in a staggered formation with 2 sections in each row. The contact us section widens to include the contact information that was origianlly in the footer.

## Optimizations

It's very easy to add too much to a website so I wanted to keep this simple. I used only a few colors and images. I wanted this page to load quickly.


## Lessons Learned:

HTML5Up makes some very impressive websites. I wanted to try my hand at recreating the "Forty" template. I took someliberties to make things my own but every time I do one of these I always learn a lot about CSS and web design in general.
